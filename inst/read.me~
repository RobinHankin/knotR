File jma_knot.tex is to be sent (eventually) to "Journal of Mathematics and the Arts".  It needs various latex style files provided by bjourdoc.zip, available at the journal website.  It also needs image files, PDF and PNG files, that are either stored in the vignettes/  directory, or created by R CMD Sweave knot.Rnw from the commandline (make sure you are in the vignettes/ directory).  So, for the JMA paper, the only file under version control is jma_knot.tex and the other files are elsewhere.
